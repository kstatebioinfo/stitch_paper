(A) The \textit  {in silico} CMAP is aligned as the reference. (B) The alignment is inverted and used as input for stitch.pl. (C) The alignments are filtered based on alignment length (purple) relative to total possible alignment length (black) and confidence. Here assuming all alignments have a high confidence score and the minimum percent aligned is 30\% two alignments fail for aligning over less than 30\% of the potential alignment length for that alignment. (D) Filtering produces an XMAP of high quality alignments with short (local) alignments removed. (E) High quality scaffolding alignments are filtered for longest and highest confidence alignment for each \textit  {in silico} CMAP. Third alignment (unshaded) is filtered because the second alignment is the longest alignment for {in silico} CMAP 2. (F) Passing alignments are used to super scaffold (captured gaps indicated in dark green). (G) Stitch is iterated and additional super scaffolding alignments are found using second best scaffolding alignments. (H) Iteration takes advantage of cases where \textit  {in silico} CMAPs scaffold BNG CMAPs as \textit  {in silico} CMAP 2 does. Stitch is run iteratively until super scaffolding alignments are found.}}{4}{figure.3}}
