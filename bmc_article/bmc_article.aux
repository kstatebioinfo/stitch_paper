(C) The alignments are filtered based on alignment length (purple) relative to total possible alignment length (black) and confidence. Here assuming all alignments have a high confidence score and the minimum percent aligned is 30\% two alignments fail for aligning over less than 30\% of the potential alignment length for that alignment. (D) Filtering produces an XMAP of high quality alignments with short (local) alignments removed. (E) High quality scaffolding alignments are filtered for longest and highest confidence alignment for each \textit  {in silico} genome map. Third alignment (unshaded) is filtered because the second alignment is the longest alignment for {in silico} genome map 2. (F) Passing alignments are used to super scaffold (captured gaps indicated in dark green). (G) Stitch is iterated and additional super scaffolding alignments are found using second best scaffolding alignments. (H) Iteration takes advantage of cases where \textit  {in silico} genome maps scaffold BioNano genome maps as \textit  {in silico} genome map 2 does. Stitch is run iteratively all until super scaffolding alignments are found.}}{10}{figure.3}}
